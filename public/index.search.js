Shaders are displayed as nodes which can be connected as needed.\nShaderMania features a database of public shaders including tutorial shaders with links to explanation videos.\nA physical keyboard is recommended for coding shaders.\nFeatures\nFlexible node system supporting Shaders and Images. Named input slots for shaders can be created inside the shader source code. Connect shader nodes to be able to chain shaders. Optional abstracted parameter definition which supports display of variables as sliders to live change shader values in the user interface. Tutorial shaders can display a button with a link to their video urls. Realtime syntax check and compilation of your shaders with realtime preview. Render to custom resolutions and export your shader output to PNG. Display of syntax errors and warnings. Database\nUpload your shaders to the public shader database Browse shaders in the Database and learn / experiment. Add the shader nodes from the database to your project. How to help Rating or reviewing ShaderMania in the AppStore is a great help as it improves visibility.\nRender-Z If you like ShaderMania, try out Render-Z, my visual Metal editor.\nGet Involved Join my Discord and get involved in everything ShaderMania.\nAcknowledgements Thanks to The Art of Code for allowing me to use his tutorial shaders.

Itâ€™s main aim is to create games similar to the RPGs of the 80â€™s and 90â€™s but with modern features as well as support for single and multi-player experiences.\nOverview\nDevelopment Status: Active. v1 in 2024. Languages: Rust Current Version: v0.89 License: MIT Website Downloads GitHub Repo RPU RPU is a GLSL compatible programming language for rendering procedural graphics on the CPU.\nAs GPU shaders can limit the complexity of what you can render, RPU aims to provide an alternative way of rendering complex, unlimited procedural graphics on the CPU, in 64-bit or 32-bit precision.\nRPU strives to be compatible with GLSL which means that you can easily port your existing shaders to RPU.\nAlternatively you can also use RPU as a general purpose mathematical scripting language, as it is designed to be fast and embeddable in your applications.\nOverview\nDevelopment Status: Active. v1 in 2024.

It features an integrated code editor, live previews and a node system to connect shaders.\nOverview\nDevelopment Status: Active Languages: Metal, Swift Current Version: v1.55 License: MIT AppStore Link GitHub Repo Planned Features\nText support using a default SDF texture A Lua control script which can call and share parameters with shaders, which would enable interactive presentations and small games.

Render-Z supports workflows to create complex expressions and shaders.\nYou can stack shaders and developers can expose variables to artists which can manipulate them using gizmos.\nOverview\nDevelopment Status: Active. v1 in 2023. Languages: Metal, Swift Current Version: v0.70 License: MIT Documentation TestFlight Link GitHub Repo Denrim Denrim is a 2D game creator utilizing a unique text based approach for game logic and resources. It is highly optimized for the Metal GPU framework and combines ease-of-use with the highest possible performance.\nDenrim utilizes a text based approach to game creation paired with instant previews and visual game state feedback. You do not need to be a developer to create games with Denrim as no scripting languages are used.\nText based behavior trees are easy-to-use yet powerful tools to create game logic and AI. They are easier to use and understand than scripting languages but are natively compiled into Swift and therefore offer the maximum in native performance. During game execution visual feedback of the state of the nodes are provided for easy debugging.\nAn integrated 2D physics engine provides realistic and fast physics for your game.\nOverview\nDevelopment Status: Inactive Languages: Metal, Swift Current Version: v1.06 License: MIT AppStore Link GitHub Repo Planned Features for v2\nSwiftUI IDE Lua scripts which talk to custom Metal shaders Tiled import for maps 2D physics ForgedThoughts ForgedThoughts is a programming language to model 3D objects.
