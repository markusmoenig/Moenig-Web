## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an open source graphics developer and here is a list of the applications I am [currently working](https://github.com/markusmoenig) on.

My apps are mostly written in Metal / Swift for the Apple ecosystem or cross-platform via Rust.

If you want to get in contact to talk about bugs or provide feedback or ideas join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BMStWPhByj) or send an [eMail](mailto:nubby.leaving0w@icloud.com).

I run a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/MarkusMoenig) in case you want to support my work, I do not do it for the money but some support is always appreciated! You can also become a [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/markusmoenig).

You can follow my blog on my Patreon or the [Whats New](./whatsnew/) section on this Website.

Here are my apps.
